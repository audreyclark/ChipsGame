# ChipsGame
The goal of the game is simple: be the player to pick up the last chip.
The game starts out by asking the user how many chips should be in the initial pile.
The number of chips in the pile can range from two to fifty, inclusive.
Next, player one is prompted to pick up chips.
The allowed number of chips to pick up is one to half of the current pile, inclusive.
The program then responds with how many chips are in the pile and a prompt to player2
to take their turn of chips.
This goes on until there is one player to pick up the last remaining chip. 
This player is declared as the winner and the program ends.
